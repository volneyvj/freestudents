FreeStudents project is a platform that connects students and teachers without any kind of financial interests. 

We mainly used handlebars and express node combined with css, js and html programing. This is the 2nd project completed at Ironhack`s WebDev FullStack BootCamp.

How does it work? 
SignUp as a teacher and add your course details with information such as: type of lecture, amount of classes, suggested schedule and your contact information.
As a student, signup and start searching for a teacher. Make you invitation and wait for the return.

Why we did it?
We see a huge discrepancy over those living in poverty conditions comparing to fortunate young 
that could study in a private school and have extra-curricular activities all day long.
