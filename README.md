FreeStudents project is a platform that connects students and teachers without any kind of financial interests. 
If you would like voluntarily  teach someone one of your specialties, FreeStudents may give you the chance to improve your pedagogic skills and you will 
also be doing something valuable for someone that has no  possibility of financing private classes at the moment. 
Subjects can go from computer coding, mentoring, languages to culinary practices.

How does it work? 
SignUp as a teacher and add your course details with information such as: type of lecture, amount of classes, suggested schedule and your contact information.
As a student, signup and start searching for a teacher. Make you invitation and wait for the return.

Why we did it?
We see a huge discrepancy over those living in poverty conditions comparing to fortunate young 
that could study in a private school and have extra-curricular activities all day long.
